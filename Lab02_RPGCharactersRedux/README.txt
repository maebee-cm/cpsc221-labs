# Lab 02: RPG Characters Redux

* Author: Mustafa Hashim
* Class: CPSC221 Section 001
* Semester: Fall 2022

## Overview

This program simulates a Dungeons and Dragons like game in text form. It creates a party composed of a knight,
a barbarian, a ranger, and a wizard, it then displays their description and showcases their fighting technique,
after which they are attacked by a dragon and have their description and status printed again.

## Compiling and Using

All the java files provided are needed for compilation. The Adventure class provides the main method, the knight
barbarian, ranger, and wizard files establish the 4 classes, the character file provides an extendable class to create
new classes, and all other files are describing weapon behaviors.

## Discussion

This was an enjoyable lab, previously it always felt like I was breaking some rule that I was unaware of (i.e. don't use
try catch, and things like it) but with this one all the instructions were clear and I had a good idea of what was
expected, which made the lab a lot easier to go through. I didn't really have any points where I struggled with this lab.
I think that the patterns that this lab employs are of clear importance to future projects that have a similar data
structure to this lab.

## Testing

I printed the contents according to the instruction sheet and then manually checked that all the information was there.
