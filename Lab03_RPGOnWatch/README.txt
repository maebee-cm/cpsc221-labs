## Overview

This program simulates Dungeons and Dragon's style set of encounters over
multiples nights, where in adventurers take turns watching over their camp
for the night. As the night progresses they voice their thoughts about what
is happening around the camp.

## Compiling and Using

All included *.java are necessary for compilation.

## Discussion

I thought this was a fairly easy and intuitive lab, I didn't have any design
issues or much trouble writing it.

## Testing

I ran the program and matched its output to the expected output as specified
by the lab instruction.
